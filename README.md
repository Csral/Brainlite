# Brainlite

*Brainlite* is a translation layer (or compiler) which makes writing  complex brainf*ck programs easier.
The core principle of the language remains completely the same, i.e only 8 operations

Brainlite introduces multiple keywords which can easen the task of writing
a brainf*ck program manually.
